# chat-app

This is a chat app project created using [chat engine](https://chatengine.io/).
This is a work in progress. Please refrain from following any of the steps. This is just for my own satisfaction.

To start the project:
1. Make sure you have nodejs installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm run dev'

NOTE: Be wary of chat engine configs first.
